# HicHacHoe

This is my first real program with Haskell. I used the Gloss library to create a simple Tic Tac Toe game. It's very elementary, but I learned a lot of functions in the standard library and how functional programming can be used to do more imperitive things? 

## Local Installation

You clone it and run stack run. It will download and build all of the Haskell files (which takes forever). You can also run the binary which is compiled for x86_64-linux.
